## Why refreshes matter

The fastest wins in content often come from tightening what already exists. When traffic or conversions dip, I start with user feedback and search data before touching copy. Quick audits surface gaps across product positioning, ICP pain points, and technical accuracy.

## The five-step workflow

1. **Re-evaluate intent** — scrape live SERPs, log People Also Ask, and identify where the existing article falls short of search expectations.
2. **Product proof** — capture new UI states, release notes, and roadmap updates that prove the product still solves the core job-to-be-done.
3. **Restructure for scannability** — adjust headings, bring answers above the fold, and add tables or diagrams to match user skim patterns.
4. **Optimize internal links** — connect the refresh to adjacent features, docs, and comparison pieces to strengthen topical authority.
5. **Re-measure with the team** — ship with annotated changelog notes, then monitor engagement, rankings, and conversion paths in the first 14 days.

## Assets you can reuse

- A refresh brief template that outlines what to collect from product, marketing, and SEO stakeholders.
- Screenshot checklist to ensure new UI states match the article's claims.
- QA rubric so reviewers can catch accuracy or compliance issues before publish.

Run this play and your refresh backlog becomes a steady pipeline of quick wins that compound over time.
